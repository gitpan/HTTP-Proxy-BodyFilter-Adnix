HTTP/Proxy/BodyFilter/Adnix version 0.01
========================================

Last update: 20/06/2004 Cosimo

This class implements a HTTP::Proxy body filter which blocks images
based on some rules you specify (or built-in default rules), and
replaces it with custom image you specify (or again, a built-in one).

Without installing HTTP::Proxy and all its components, you won't
be able to do anything useful with this software.
